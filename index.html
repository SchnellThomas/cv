        <p><em>Software Developer @ <strong>PGIP</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am currently a Senior in Information Technology at Purdue University Global. I am pursuing a major in IT with a concentration in Programming and Software Development. I'm currently in a Internship through PGIP where I engage with
          colleagues on
          current and future tasks and projects to work on that include building server-less applications using AWS and updating websites. My learning and understanding of web development has grown with much more to learn. In my free time I enjoy
          helping
          out with my local American Legion where we help the community come together and celebrate events. Also, I coach soccer for children to further their understanding for the love and passion many people around the world have for the game.
          Lastly, I
          try to educate myself on current and future trends within Software Development by taking courses on freeCodeCamp, Code Academy, Udemy and more. At the end of the day I aspire to be the happiest, most successful, and best version of myself.
          I am
          currently open to future internships, entry level jobs or just to chat about current/future technologies and software implementations. </p>
